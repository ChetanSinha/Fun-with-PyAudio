# Fun-with-PyAudio

## Jarvis, The Voice Assistent:
This is a low quality, just for fun based voice assistent and a pretty much lazy AI bot, which works on if-else statement(huh!), some major libraries used in this work are speech_recognition, requests and Beutiful Soup.
So, if you are free enough to spend couple of minute for a low quality search using your microphone (which you can type and search faster comparatively) then you are welcome to clone the repository.... :D

## Newspaper Reader:
This is a voice assistent for newspaper reading, you just give your favourite newspaper name and sit back and listen to the news, this is using api from https://newsapi.org, you need to use your own api key in place mentioned, you'll get the one once you'll sign up at newsapi.org.....happy reading :D
